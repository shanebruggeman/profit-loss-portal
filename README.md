# profit-loss-portal
This project aims to create a real time database of trades that calculates the profit and loss of trades, incorporating the various exchange fees. This application is assessed through a web page that allows the account manager to specify the time period to view, showing a summary of that time period's profits and allow them to drill down to the individual trades.
